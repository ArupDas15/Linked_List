 Summary of the approach:
 In-order Morris Traversal:
ðŸŒ³ 1st case: if left is null, print current node and go right
ðŸŒ³ 2nd case: before going left, make right most node on left subtree connected to current node, then go left
ðŸŒ³ 3rd case: if thread is already pointed to current node, then remove the thread

/*
Below is my observation regarding Morris Inorder Traversal:

We are visiting the left subtree thrice:

1. To mark the reference to the current node from the rightmost node of the left subtree of the current node.
2. To perform inorder traversal and store the key in the inoder vector.
3. To check if there exists a link to the current node, then remove the link and go to the right subtree of the current node.

It is the rightmost subtree in the binary tree, which is visited only once. So we can say the time complexity is O(3n), i.e. O(n).
